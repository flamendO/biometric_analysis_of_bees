# Biometric analysis of bees

# Context

The black bee is the bee that has lived in our regions for thousands of years. She knew how to adapt to our
regions and proves to be very robust while producing honey correctly. CETA seeks to preserve
at best this bee and established two high-altitude apiaries in Savoie, allowing queens to be raised
black bees, or to have their queens fertilized by black bee drones.

To be able to evaluate the percentage of membership of a queen and therefore of her swarm, to
the black bee, it is possible to do biometrics
To do this, around a hundred bees are taken from the hive, from which the wings are recovered to
then analyze it from characteristic points

Several tracks will be possible in this subject, which allows several tracks to be processed in parallel. There
first is to automate the extraction of wing characteristic points from images and
to extract the associated measurements (as shown in the images above).
Another technique, which will require bibliographic research, is to use AI techniques, such as
neural networks
In both cases, preprocessing of the wing images will be necessary to ensure usability.

The objective is to be able to isolate each wing, carry out a treatment and carry out a detection of particular points to make ulnar calculations.
